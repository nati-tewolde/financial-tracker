# Financial Tracker: Accounting Ledger Application

## Description 

Financial Tracker is a Java-based command-line application that assists users in tracking their financial transactions for personal & business use.
It supports adding new transactions, displaying them in ledgers, and filtering through multiple types of financial reports.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want my transactions to be saved & displayed accurately, so that I can view my deposits and payments later.
- As a user, I want my saved transactions to load as I start the application, so that I can view my current/previous payments & deposits.
- As a user, I want to record a new deposit, so that my transaction ledger reflects the money I've received.
- As a user, I want to record a new (debit) payment, so that my transaction ledger includes the money I've spent.
- As a user, I want to view all my transactions in one place, so that I can review my complete financial history.
- As a user, I want to exclusively view my deposits, so that I can review all the money I've received.
- As a user, I want to view only my payments, so that I can track all the money I've spent.
- As a user, I want to view transactions within a specific date range, so that I can review my financial activity during that period.
- As a user, I want to view all transactions based on a specific vendor, so that I can track my spending/income in relation to that vendor.
- As a user, I want to search for transactions using a combination of filters, so that I can easily find specific transactions without browsing through my entire ledger.
